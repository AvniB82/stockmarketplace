## Usage

To use the application search for any stock name/ticker symbol. If you input a symbol which doesn't exist or if you input a stock and the API has reached its limit you will receive an error message. When searching for a stock like for example TSLA, you will be shown basic information on Tesla and all the recent news regarding the company. You also have two buttons where you can close details and you can add to watchlist. When adding to watchlist if you navigate to that page you can either access the stocks details by clicking on the stocks ticker symbol or you can remove that stock from the watchlist. Stocks added to the watchlist are saved to local storage.
